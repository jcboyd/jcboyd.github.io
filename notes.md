My favourite approach to learning is to take notes. The apotheosis of this is in maintaining a LaTeX document. This way, note taking becomes serious, and when hosted on  Where possible I like to supplement my notes with code.

## Last chance stats

[Last chance stats](/assets/lastchancestats/main.pdf) (statistics) covers core topics in number theory, statistics, machine learning, and computer science. I aim that each section covers a self-contained lesson. The accompanying MATLAB code can be found [here](https://github.com/jcboyd/lastchancestats/tree/master/Demos).

## Last chance bio

Last chance bio (biology) is my attempt at summarising the basics of molecular and cell biology.

## Last chance lit

Last chance lit (literature) contains the summaries of interesting articles I have come across throughout my research. It consists mostly of papers on high content screening or deep/transfer learning. I hope that one day it will form the basis of a beautiful dissertation.

## Misc

I also like to take notes on important softwares like [git](https://github.com/jcboyd/git-notes/blob/master/git-notes.sh), [Bash](https://github.com/jcboyd/bash-notes/blob/master/notes.sh), or [C++](https://github.com/jcboyd/cpp-notes/blob/master/Notes.cpp).
