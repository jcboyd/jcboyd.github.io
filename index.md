I am a PhD student at the [Centre for Computational Biology](http://cbio.ensmp.fr/) (CBIO) at [MINES Paristech](http://www.mines-paristech.fr/) and affiliated with the [Institut Curie](http://www.institut-curie.org/). CBIO is dedicated to answering questions in biology and cancer treatment using the tools of statistical learning and mathematical modeling. I am supervised by [Thomas Walter](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~twalter/).

## Research interests

I am most interested in machine learning and its applications. At CBIO I am researching ways of improving [high content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-content_screening) analysis using deep learning.

## Biography

I obtained my bachelor degrees in Mathematics and Information Technology from [Queensland University of Technology](https://www.qut.edu.au/) (QUT) in Brisbane, Australia. After some years in the engineering industry, I pursued a masters in computer science from [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/) (EPFL) in Lausanne, Switzerland.
