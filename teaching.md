* **(November, 2018)** I presented the introductory workshop at MINES Paristech course [*Deep Learning For Image Analysis*](https://github.com/ThomasWalter/DeepLearningForImageAnalysis)

* **(November, 2018)** I presented my deep learning workshop in lecture form to 2nd year students as part of PSL course *Génomique et Bioinformatique: Une Introduction*.

* **(March, 2018)** I was teaching assistant during the workshops of [Large-Scale Machine Learning and Data Mining](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/svn/lsml/lsml18/) at MINES Paristech. I also created the workshop on [stochastic gradient descent](https://jcboyd.github.io/assets/lsml2018/stochastic_gradient_descent.html).

* **(October, 2017)** My deep learning workshop will feature in PSL course *Introduction to Bioinformatics and Genomics* with a [new branch for cell data](https://github.com/jcboyd/deep-learning-workshop/tree/cell-data).

* **(October, 2017-January, 2018)** I am currently a teaching assistant for course *Introduction to Machine Learning* at CentraleSupélec in Autumn, 2017. Public version of labs available [here](https://github.com/chagaz/ma2823_2017). Solved versions of labs I was responsible for creating are [Intro/PCA](/assets/ma2823_2017/Lab+1+2017-10-02++Principal+Components+Analysis.html), [Convex Optimisation](/assets/ma2823_2017/Lab+2+2017-10-06++Convex+optimization+in+Python.html), and [Support Vector Machines](/assets/ma2823_2017/Lab+8++2017-12-01++Support+vector+machines.html).

* **(May, 2017)** I gave a [workshop on deep learning](/assets/deep-learning-workshop/main.html) with TensorFlow at our lab retreat in May, 2017. I have also made Docker images of the workshop available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jcboyd/deep-learning-workshop/).

* **(March, 2017)** I was teaching assistant during the workshops of [Large-Scale Machine Learning and Data Mining](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/svn/lsml/lsml17/) at MINES Paristech.
