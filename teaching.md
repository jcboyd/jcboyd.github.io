* **(May, 2017)** I gave a [workshop on deep learning](/assets/deep-learning-workshop/main.html) with TensorFlow at our lab retreat in May, 2017. I have also made Docker images of the workshop available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jcboyd/deep-learning-workshop/).

* **(March, 2017)** I was teaching assistant during the workshops of [Large-Scale Machine Learning and Data Mining](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/svn/lsml/lsml17/) at MINES Paristech.
